To make your submission stand out, a perfect README should explain exactly what the project is, how to set it up, and how to test the APIs.

Create a file named README.md in your root folder and paste this content:
Library Management System (MERN)

A full-stack Library Management System built as part of a technical task. The system allows users to register, login, and manage books, including issuing and returning books with real-time stock updates.
🚀 Features

    User Authentication: Secure Register and Login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

    Book Management: Add new books and view all available books.

    Issue/Return System:

        Users can issue a book (decreases availableCopies).

        Users can return a book (increases availableCopies).

        Prevents issuing books that are out of stock.

        Prevents users from issuing the same book twice simultaneously.
